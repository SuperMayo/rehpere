We deeply regret to announce you that our conference “Recent Shifts in the Boundaries of Economics: Philosophy and History,” initially scheduled for 4-6 January 2022, has to postponed to a further date (May 30th - June 1st 2022).


Unfortunately, the dynamics of the epidemics in France resulted, in the past days, in new health-safety regulations applying to all scientific events hosted in French universities. These new constraints (enforced at least until the end of January) have made impossible for our conference to take place in acceptable conditions. Notably, it would be impossible to have lunch and coffee breaks on site.

Taking into account the current epidemiological forecasts, the organizing committee has hence decided to postpone the conference to next Spring.

The conference will take place on Monday, May 30th, Tuesday May 31st , and Wednesday, June 1st 2022. The conference will begin on Monday at 10.30 a.m. with a session in honor of Hubert Brochier, who, as a professor at the University of Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne, was the first to introduce research into the epistemology and philosophy of economics into the French university.


The conference will still be held in the “hybrid” format, that is, simultaneously, in person in Paris (Maison des Sciences économiques) and online (Zoom) for those who would be unable to attend in person.


We are very sorry about the inconvenience that this postponement would cause to most of you. We sincerely hope that you will all be able to join us in May, either in person or virtually. If you wish, however, to withdraw your paper and participation from the conference, please let us know as soon as possible (by writing to Annie.Cot@univ-paris1.fr and to Dorian.Jullien@univ-paris1.fr).


We will try to keep thematic parallel sessions and the conference schedule the same as the one announced in the preliminary version of the programme (that we circulated a couple of weeks ago). We will be in touch with all of you, in due course, about the conference programme. Concerning the submission of full papers, the deadline for submission is moved to April 15th 2022.


We look forward to seeing you in May.
