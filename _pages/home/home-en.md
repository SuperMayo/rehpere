# REHPERE ?

The Network in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought (*Réseau en Epistémologie et en Histoire de la Pensée Economique Récente*) brings together research on the evolution of economics from the late 19<sup>th</sup> to the early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. REHPERE is a network of researchers resting upon the research team in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought, one of the teams of the Centre d’Economie de la Sorbonne (CES, axis "institutions and regulations", UMR 8174 CNRS - University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne). REHPERE gathers researchers from other research centers, whose members share common research programs.

The members of the REHPERE team explore the evolution of the relationships between economics and other disciplines. Our common themes are: the getting beyond methodological individualism, the relationship between economic representations and public policies, the role of economists in expertise, the analysis of the role of economic tools (modeling, simulations, experiments, etc.) in controversies of methods and outside the academic world (public sphere, expertise, courts).
The work of the REHPERE team is currently organized around five sections: epistemology and methodology of theories and economic practices; history of macroeconomics since the 1970s; economics and psychology; history and epistemology of applied microeconomics; public economy and political economy of authorities.

        The first section is devoted to the epistemology and the methodology of economic theories and practices of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. It includes Jerome Lallement's research on the epistemology of Leon Walras or on the history and evolution of the opposition between methodological individualism and holism; this of Cristian Frasser on monetary practices and the nature of money; this of Juan Melo on the relations between cybernetics and economy since the 1940s; or this of Nathanael Colin-Jaeger on social ontology and liberal anthropology. In addition, there is also the work of Nicolas Brisset on performativity and the economics of conventions, this of Justine Loulergue on the metaphors of equilibrium, or this of Annie L. Cot on the emergence of economic expertise, the institutionalization of "seminars" in the discipline and the entry of women into academic in France.rance.

       This second section is dedicated to the history of macroeconomics since the 1970s. This research is as much concerned with the evolution of theories as with the transformation of econometric practices, at the frontier between academia and expertise. It includes Matthieu Renault's research on Edmond Malinvaud, Aurélien Goutsmedt's work on the transformation of macroeconomics in the 1970s, Erich Pinzón-Fuchs on Lawrence Klein and the development of macro-econometrics, as well as Francesco Sergi's research on the history of DSGE models. Thomas Delcey also fits in this second section with the epistemological analysis of the efficient market hypothesis. Quentin Couix proposes growth analyzes that integrate Nicolas Georgescu-Roegen's thermodynamics.

      A third section is devoted to the history and the epistemology of the relationship between psychology and economics. It includes Annie L. Cot's work on the pre-history of experimental facts as well as her work on the Harvard Pareto circle. Part of the team is also working on the new directions of economic research since the "empirical turn," particularly neuroeconomics (Nicolas Vallois) and experimental and behavioral economics (Dorian Jullien). The theme of trust is at the heart of the work of Pierrick Dechaux on household satisfaction’s indicators and Nicolas Camilotto on the history of trust economics since the 1980s at the interface with sociology. Jean-Sébastien Lenfant pursues research on consumer theories mirroring psychology and economics. Niels Boissonnet and Guilhem Lecouteux work on the endogenous formation of individual preferences, in particular Niels Boissonnet develops an analysis that aims to go beyond traditional conceptions based on preferences that are given and stable over time, while Guilhem Lecouteux explores the normative implications in terms of public policies of these endogenous changes of preference.

        A fourth section researches the history and epistemology of recent microeconomics. Judith Favereau focuses on the philosophy of development economics, and in particular on randomized controlled field trials. Guillaume Noblet works on the history of economic experiments in agriculture in the United States. Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche and Annie L. Cot are working on the history of the "equal pay for equal work" controversy in the UK. More generally, Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche works on the history of discrimination economics as a field of knowledge and expertise. Tom Juille also insers his research on the identity of agents in this section.

      Finally, the fifth section focuses on "non-private property" and public authorities. Jérôme Lallement's work on the     surpassing of methodological individualism and Maxime Desmarais-Tremblay's work on "meritorious" goods and consumer sovereignty fall within this category. Raphaël Fèvre works on the political economy of public authorities, including the history of ordoliberalism. With Nicolas Brisset, he participates to a research program on economics and economists during the Vichy regime, which also includes François Allisson, Tom Juille, and Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche. Maria Bach studies how Indian economists shaped a concept of development at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century in a context of colonization.
