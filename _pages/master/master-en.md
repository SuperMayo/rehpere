# Presentation of the Master
{: #presentation}

Unique in France, the Master "Economics and Human Sciences: epistemology, methods, theories" at the University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne focuses on the epistemology of economics and the analysis of the shifting boundaries between economic and social sciences.

The ESH Master's degree aims to question the foundations and methods of contemporary economic theory while exploring its multiple relationships with other human and social sciences: law, philosophy, sociology, psychology.

Over the last three decades, fields situated at the frontiers of economics and these disciplines have been particularly active: social justice theories, economics of law, economic sociology and the economics of social interactions, economic psychology (from neuroeconomics to the economics of happiness), etc. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between these disciplines and the humanities and social sciences.

The objective of this specialization is therefore to resituate this research, which renews the discipline, in its transdisciplinary context, by putting it into historical, methodological and epistemological perspective, which is essential to fully grasp the issues at stake.

# The Master Dissertation
{: #memoire}

The validation of the Master ESH includes the writing of a research thesis, under the supervision of members of the teaching team of the Master.

The thesis occupies an important place in the training program. Indeed, it is the privileged moment to acquire the skills specific to the research professions:

- mastering an academic literature on a specific subject;

- developing an original point of view on a research question;

- writing a scientific contribution;

- knowing how to present and defend one's work.

# Job Opportunities
{: #debouches}

- Knowledge and skills
    + The Master 2 in Economics and Human Sciences prepares students for research (thesis writing, positions in the research departments of public or private organizations), teaching competitions, international organizations and, more generally, institutions looking for "generalist" economists, capable of putting contemporary economic theories into a historical and philosophical perspective.
- Professions
    + The M2 ESH aims to develop skills in research-based learning, in particular through thesis work. Students acquire intellectual tools that prepare ::
        * employment in academic research, often preparing a PhD after M2 ;
        * a job in education (high school, prepas, business schools) ;
        * work in public institutions (e.g. Ministry of Finance, Central Banks) or international institutions (UNESCO, OECD) ;
        * to a job in the private sector (e.g. journalist, consultant).
- Profiles
    + The M2 ESH is designed to accommodate a variety of profiles. While a majority of students have previously studied economics, students from other humanities disciplines are still very well represented (in particular politicians, philosophers and sociologists). Finally, the M2 is marked by its strong international character.
