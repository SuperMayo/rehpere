# Presentation of the Master
{: #presentation}

Unique in France, the Master "Economics and Human Sciences: epistemology, methods, theories" at the University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne focuses on the epistemology of economics and the analysis of the shifting boundaries between economic and social sciences.

The ESH Master's degree aims to question the foundations and methods of contemporary economic theory while exploring its multiple relationships with other human and social sciences: law, philosophy, sociology, psychology.

Over the last three decades, fields situated at the frontiers of economics and these disciplines have been particularly active: social justice theories, economics of law, economic sociology and the economics of social interactions, economic psychology (from neuroeconomics to the economics of happiness), etc. The aim of this paper is to explore the relationship between these disciplines and the humanities and social sciences.

The objective of this specialization is therefore to resituate this research, which renews the discipline, in its transdisciplinary context, by putting it into historical, methodological and epistemological perspective, which is essential to fully grasp the issues at stake.

# The Master Dissertation
{: #memoire}

The validation of the Master ESH includes the writing of a research thesis, under the supervision of members of the teaching team of the Master.

The thesis occupies an important place in the training program. Indeed, it is the privileged moment to acquire the skills specific to the research professions:

- mastering an academic literature on a specific subject;

- developing an original point of view on a research question;

- writing a scientific contribution;

- knowing how to present and defend one's work.

## Method Seminars

Research work, like writing a dissertation, is neither an innate skill nor a solitary occupation. For these reasons, the research team of the ESH Master's program complements the supervision of each thesis director with two seminars.

 - __Method Seminar__ _Annie Cot and Jérôme Lallement_
   * This seminar aims to give Master's students a general perspective on the method to be adopted to complete a research dissertation. The seminar gives elements of reference between the different existing historiographical approaches, on text commentaries as well as formal elements.
   The validation of the seminar is done by a reading report on a book of the student's choice.

 - __Albert O. Hirschman Seminar__
   * This seminar, led by the REhPERE doctoral team, helps each master's student to perfect his or her thesis. Each student presents the progress of his or her work in the form of a project summary, detailed plan or chapter.
   For one hour, the students' work is submitted to the comments and criticism of other students and doctoral students. These discussions help to highlight the improvements and developments to be made to each student's work. The doctoral students make their experience of research work available. This seminar is a collaborative space. It does not give rise to evaluation.

# Job Opportunities
{: #debouches}

- Knowledge and skills
    + The Master 2 in Economics and Human Sciences prepares students for research (thesis writing, positions in the research departments of public or private organizations), teaching competitions, international organizations and, more generally, institutions looking for "generalist" economists, capable of putting contemporary economic theories into a historical and philosophical perspective.
- Professions
    + The M2 ESH aims to develop skills in research-based learning, in particular through thesis work. Students acquire intellectual tools that prepare ::
        * employment in academic research, often preparing a PhD after M2 ;
        * a job in education (high school, prepas, business schools) ;
        * work in public institutions (e.g. Ministry of Finance, Central Banks) or international institutions (UNESCO, OECD) ;
        * to a job in the private sector (e.g. journalist, consultant).
- Profiles
    + The M2 ESH is designed to accommodate a variety of profiles. While a majority of students have previously studied economics, students from other humanities disciplines are still very well represented (in particular politicians, philosophers and sociologists). Finally, the M2 is marked by its strong international character.
