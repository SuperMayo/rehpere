# REHPERE ?

The *Réseau en Epistémologie et en Histoire de la Pensée Economique Récente* (stands for Network in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought) brings together researches on the evolution of economics from the late  19<sup>th</sup> to the early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. REHPERE is a network of researchers based on the research team in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought, one of the teams of the Centre d’Economie de la Sorbonne (CES, axis "Institutions and Regulations", UMR 8174 CNRS - University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne). REHPERE gathers researchers from other research centers, whose members share common research programs.

The members of the REHPERE team explore the evolution of the frontiers of economics in relation to other disciplines. Our common themes are: the getting beyond methodological individualism, the relationship between economic representations and public policies, the role of economists as experts, the analysis of the role of economic tools (modeling, simulations, experiments, etc.) in controversies of methods and outside the academic world (public sphere, expertise, courts).

        The first axis is devoted to the epistemology and the methodology of economic theories and practices of the 20<sup>th</sup> and 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. It includes Jerome Lallement's research on the epistemology of Léon Walras and on the history of the opposition between methodological individualism and holism; Cristian Frasser’s research on monetary practices and the nature of money; the work of Juan Melo on the relations between cybernetics and economics since the 1940s; or this of Nathanael Colin-Jaeger on social ontology and liberal anthropology. In addition, there is also the work of Nicolas Brisset on performativity and the economics of conventions, Justine Loulergue ongoing research on the metaphors of equilibrium, or the current research of Annie L. Cot on the emergence of economic expertise, the institutionalization of "seminars" in the discipline and the entry of women into academic in France.

This second axis is devoted to the history of macroeconomics since the 1970s. This research is concerned with both the evolution of theories and the transformation of econometric modelling practices, at the interface of academia and expertise. It includes Matthieu Renault's research on Edmond Malinvaud, Aurélien Goutsmedt's work on the transformation of macroeconomics in the 1970s, Erich Pinzón-Fuchs on Lawrence Klein and the development of macro-econometrics, as well as Francesco Sergi's research on the history of DSGE models. Thomas Delcey also fits in this second axis with his epistemological analysis of the efficient market hypothesis. Quentin Couix works on growth models that integrate Nicolas Georgescu-Roegen's thermodynamics.

   A third axis is devoted to the history and the epistemology of the relationship between psychology and economics. It includes Annie L. Cot's work on the pre-history of experimental facts as well as her work on the Harvard Pareto circle. Part of the team is also working on new directions of economic research since the "empirical turn," particularly neuroeconomics (Nicolas Vallois) and experimental and behavioral economics (Dorian Jullien). The theme of trust is at the heart of the work of Pierrick Dechaux on household satisfaction’s indicators and Nicolas Camilotto on the history of trust in economics since the 1980s at the interface with sociology. Jean-Sébastien Lenfant pursues research on consumer theories in psychology and economics. Niels Boissonnet and Guilhem Lecouteux work on the endogenous formation of individual preferences: Niels Boissonnet develops an analysis that go beyond traditional conceptions based on preferences that are given and stable over time, while Guilhem Lecouteux explores the normative implications in terms of public policies of these endogenous changes of preference.

       A fourth axis researches the history and epistemology of recent applied and theoretical microeconomics. Judith Favereau focuses on the philosophy of development economics, and in particular on randomized controlled field trials. Guillaume Noblet works on the history of economic experiments in agriculture in the United States. Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche and Annie L. Cot are working on the history of the "equal pay for equal work" controversy in the UK. More generally, Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche works on the history of discrimination in economics as a field of knowledge and a practice of expertise. Tom Juille’s research on the economics of identity is also part of this axis.

      Finally, the fifth section focuses on "non-private property" and power. Jérôme Lallement's work on methodological individualism and Maxime Desmarais-Tremblay's work on “merit goods” and consumer sovereignty fall within this stream of research. Raphaël Fèvre works on the political economy of power, and especially on the history of ordo-liberalism. Together with Nicolas Brisset, he participates to a research program on economics and economists during the Vichy regime, which also includes François Allisson, Tom Juille, and Cléo Chassonnery-Zaïgouche. Maria Bach studies how Indian economists shaped a concept of development at the turn of the 19<sup>th</sup> century in the context of colonization.

# Cercle d'Epistemologie Economique

Operating since 1988, the Cercle d'Épistémologie Économique is a seminar devoted to questions of epistemology and economic philosophy and the history of economic thought. It meets once or twice a month at the Maison des sciences économiques in Paris, on Thursdays from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.; the one-hour presentation is followed by a discussion. The seminar brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines: economics of course, but also political philosophy, sociology, intellectual history, and philosophy of science, history of science, sociology of science, economic history. Its objective is to present, discuss and contribute to the advancement of research on the foundations of the social sciences in general and economics in particular. Particular attention is given to recent developments in economic theory and its related disciplines (statistics, modeling, econometrics), methodology, and issues of boundaries between disciplines.

# Albert O. Hirschman seminar

The Albert O. Hirschman Seminar (AOH) is the internal seminar of the REhPERE network, intended for the discussion of the work of doctoral students. It meets every month. Doctoral students submit a chapter of their thesis or a current article for discussion.

# REHPERE seminar

The REhPERE seminar is held once a year as a multi-day seminar. An important part of each annual seminar is devoted to the discussion of research issues that cut across the network. The annual seminar also includes presentations of research articles or thesis chapters by network members (PhD students, young PhDs and senior researchers).
