# REHPERE ?

The *Réseau en Epistémologie et en Histoire de la Pensée Economique Récente* (stands for Network in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought) brings together researches on the evolution of economics from the late  19<sup>th</sup> to the early 21<sup>st</sup> centuries. REHPERE is a network of researchers based on the research team in Epistemology and History of Recent Economic Thought, one of the teams of the Centre d’Economie de la Sorbonne (CES, axis "Institutions and Regulations", UMR 8174 CNRS - University Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne). REHPERE gathers researchers from other research centers, whose members share common research programs.

The members of the REHPERE team explore the evolution of the frontiers of economics in relation to other disciplines. Our common themes are: the getting beyond methodological individualism, the relationship between economic representations and public policies, the role of economists as experts, the analysis of the role of economic tools (modeling, simulations, experiments, etc.) in controversies of methods and outside the academic world (public sphere, expertise, courts).


# Cercle d'Epistemologie Economique

Operating since 1988, the Cercle d'Épistémologie Économique is a seminar devoted to questions of epistemology and economic philosophy and the history of economic thought. It meets once or twice a month at the Maison des sciences économiques in Paris, on Thursdays from 6:00 to 8:00 p.m.; the one-hour presentation is followed by a discussion. The seminar brings together researchers from a variety of disciplines: economics of course, but also political philosophy, sociology, intellectual history, and philosophy of science, history of science, sociology of science, economic history. Its objective is to present, discuss and contribute to the advancement of research on the foundations of the social sciences in general and economics in particular. Particular attention is given to recent developments in economic theory and its related disciplines (statistics, modeling, econometrics), methodology, and issues of boundaries between disciplines.

# Albert O. Hirschman seminar

The Albert O. Hirschman Seminar (AOH) is the internal seminar of the REhPERE network, intended for the discussion of the work of doctoral students. It meets every month. Doctoral students submit a chapter of their thesis or a current article for discussion.

# REHPERE seminar

The REhPERE seminar is held once a year as a multi-day seminar. An important part of each annual seminar is devoted to the discussion of research issues that cut across the network. The annual seminar also includes presentations of research articles or thesis chapters by network members (PhD students, young PhDs and senior researchers).
